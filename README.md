# KotlinRomanRestlet

Welcome to the readme file for the Kotlin Roman Restlet

Customer functionality requires the need to convert an integer number from 1-3000 into a String Roman Numeral.
Second customers will need backward compatability to convert Roman String back into integer value
Lastly, RESTLet to allow for a user that does not know what their input is to allow RESTLet to decide.

Developer Notes:

Going to launch a small microservice for this solution.  Use Javalin to open a lightweight restlet interface and create a DAO to perform the conversion of data.
Test classes added to test RESTLet functionality and conversion solutions

Dependencies:

Javalin (Restlet)
jUnit (Testing)
okhttp (Teting)
